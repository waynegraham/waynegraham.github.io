<p>Last week I was on a panel at the Organization of American Historian's Annual Meeting up in DC with some folks from <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/">CHNM</a>. One of the really cool thing that I've noticed is every time I'm around those folks, I get ideas...which can be dangerous. I had been meaning to poke at the Zotero API for a while and after talking with <a href="http://twitter.com/tjowens/">@tjowens</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/joegilbert">@joegilbert</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/clioweb">@clioweb</a> over some falafels, I started putting some ideas together on the train home.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I've been working on-and-off on improving the <a href="http://deca.swem.wm.edu/">Database of Early Chesapeake Architecture</a>. I'd recently gotten the data (again) from Swem Library and had been working on pushing it to a more open framework (it was ColdFusion + MSSQL; now Rails + Postgresql). What I wanted to be able to add in is an extensible method of citation for the various buildings and sites used (check out the <a href="http://deca.heroku.com">work-in-progress</a>). At the time, I tried to use RefWorks (with very little success) to handle the citations, but with the improvements to Zotero (and it's Group ability), I thought I'd go down this road and test if this is a viable method of citation management.</p>
<p>I first took a look at Jeremy's <a href="http://github.com/clioweb/phpZotero">phpZotero code</a>. The first thing I noticed is that there's a pretty funky way that you have to construct URLs for the &quot;API&quot; (I think the Zotero API is more of an RSS decorator than an API, but hopefully they're working on that). Essentially you construct a URL requests to the Zotero API server with a user ID. Unfortunately, most people don't know their user_id, so the PHP code goes and looks this up on a different server, parses out the user_id, then constructs an HTTP request for RSS data from the API server. I kind of brace a bit at the thought of every request needing to go to two servers (multiple points of failure, speed, etc.). When I started creating a ruby wrapper for these calls, I made the object use the user_id (Integer) and not the user_name (String). Knowing folks might not know their user_id, I whipped up a quick Sinatra app on heroku to look up Zotero User ids: <a href="http://zotero-id-finder.heroku.com/">zotero-id-finder</a> (source on <a href="http://github.com/waynegraham/Zotero-ID-Finder">github</a>).</p>
<p>Next, I needed something to not have to use Nokogiri all the time to grab info off the Zotero server. I made a basic Gem to wrap these requests named <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rzotero">rzotero</a>. This is really helpful, but what I really wanted to do is add citations to ActiveRecord models a la acts_as_taggable. To that end, I started mocking up <a href="http://github.com/waynegraham/acts_as_citable">acts_as_citable</a> which will allow you to add in citations identifiers to be used with rzotero plugin to record and display items in a collection in ActiveRecord contexts.</p>
<p>As a warning, all of these are in a pre-alpha-ish state and may (badly) break your code (especially since it's lightly tested right now). As things progress, I'll have more posts here, and over on the <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab site</a>.</p>
