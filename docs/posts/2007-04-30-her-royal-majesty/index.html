<p>Ok, it's been a while. I've been working on some non-ColdFusion projects so I've been a bit remiss in keeping things up-to-date here. But big news (at least for William and Mary). Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II will be visiting William and Mary this Friday as part Jamestown's 400th anniversary.</p>
<p>Normally this wouldn't be related to ColdFusion at all, but last week it was announced that she would be coming here and thus ensued a mad rush to get an <a href="http://swem.wm.edu/exhibits/queen/">online exhibit of the Queen's 1957 visit up</a> that would make available pretty much everything we have stored in our Special Collections from her previous visit. I got to use Model-Glue after a long time of not looking at it. I had almost forgotten how painless Model-Glue makes putting projects like this together.</p>
<p>I just wanted to give a big thanks to Joe Rinehart and Doug Hughes for bringing the &quot;rapid&quot; back into rapid application development!</p>
