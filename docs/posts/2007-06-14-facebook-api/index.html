<p>I've been kind of silent here as I've been trying to keep this blog at least somewhat focused on ColdFusion and I've been doing development in some different languages as of late (Java, PHP, and Ruby). However, when Facebook released their API for developers, my summer assistant Phil started hacking away at it and we've released our first app for Facebook: <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/swemtools/">SwemTools</a>.</p>
<p>It does a couple of things, provides a search interface for both the online catalog and our website, news feeds, hours, and a bit of a neat application based on <a href="http://swem.wm.edu/services/swemsignal/">Swem Signal</a> that was created by <a href="http://wm.facebook.com/profile.php?id=7605710">Tom MacWright</a>.</p>
<p>We're still working on the code for the Signals part, but the idea is that on a map of the library, you'd be able to see where your friends are. Right now, you can see a dot where your friends are, but not who they are...but we're working on a solution for it.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, check it out...you can add me as a friend too.</div></p>
