<p>I've been knocked out by a really bad cold the last couple of weeks and I'm just starting to get things back to normal. I did want to send a quick post on the status of the SolColdfusion project. After seeing Ray's Seeker project, it reminded me that I hadn't set up a project at RIAForge yet, so I took care of that last night. You can now access the official project at <a href="http://solcoldfusion.riaforge.org/">http://solcoldfusion.riaforge.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Since the project site is up-and-running, I also submitted it to the Solr project <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-404">SOLR-404</a> (I know it's a coincidence that it's number 404, but it makes me wonder if it's some type of bad omen ;) ...). Anyway, if you think the client should get included in the project, be sure to vote for it!</p>
<p>I've also been working on a generic interface, much like Erik Hatcher's <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Flare">Solr Flare</a>. It's been a bit slow coming as I've not had a lot of time to work on these projects, but hopefully things will settle down shortly so I can devote a bit more time to them.</p>
