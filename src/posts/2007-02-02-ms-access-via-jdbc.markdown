    6 years old). I haven't done anything with ColdFusion in a couple of years, but
    what are you trying to do?"

We recently made the move from an IIS Windows web server to an Apache *nix based web server as part of our efforts to consolidate our library's server infrastructure. And for reasons I won't expound upon, we had one MS Access DSN that didn't get migrated to MSSQL and that needed to be used still. Since ColdFusion uses a Windows only driver for MS Access, I needed to figure out a way around this. I found a couple of JDBC drivers for Access (Easysoft's <a href="http://www.easysoft.com/products/data_access/jdbc_odbc_bridge/index.html">JDBC-ODBC Bridge</a> and HXTT's <a href="http://www.hxtt.com/access.html">Access Pure Java JDBC Drivers</a>), but these seemed to be a bit on the expensive side for the short amount of time that I'd need to keep Access in production.

I did notice on Easysoft's website that they were using the JdbcOdbc bridge, so after a little bit more digging, I found the syntax to use configure ColdFusion to use MS Access through the JdbcOdbc Bridge; the JDBC URL is

~~~
jdbc:odbc:Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};DBQ=/path/to/datasource.mdb;DriverID22;
~~~

and the Driver Class

~~~
sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver
~~~

For the very basic inserting of data from a seldom-used web form into a single table, this band aid fix has been doing pretty good!
