Ok, it's been a while. I've been working on some non-ColdFusion projects so I've been a bit remiss in keeping things up-to-date here. But big news (at least for William and Mary). Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II will be visiting William and Mary this Friday as part Jamestown's 400th anniversary.

Normally this wouldn't be related to ColdFusion at all, but last week it was announced that she would be coming here and thus ensued a mad rush to get an <a href="http://swem.wm.edu/exhibits/queen/">online exhibit of the Queen's 1957 visit up</a> that would make available pretty much everything we have stored in our Special Collections from her previous visit. I got to use Model-Glue after a long time of not looking at it. I had almost forgotten how painless Model-Glue makes putting projects like this together.

I just wanted to give a big thanks to Joe Rinehart and Doug Hughes for bringing the "rapid" back into rapid application development!
