Just received two of Sun's 24TB Sun Fire x4500 Thumper boxes! The plan (at least right now) is to run SMB and NFS shares so the folks in our media studios can actually put their info on something a bit more stable than the local macs. We have a triple-speed network switch between the Macs and our server room (though they I haven't seen any computers here that can actually handle data that fast), but it should be pretty zippy. We'll also be able to consolidate the storage (hopefully) of our institutional repository and staff file storage.

We're also getting a 10Gig switch put in this December so we can surf Internet2 at super speed (or at least the folks working in the Integrated Graphics Lab will be able to send their jobs to the super computers faster)!
