It's been a long while since I posted anything here. Things have been a bit hectic with the launching of a new institutional repository service (using DSpace), taking a computer graphics course (linear algebra, ray tracing, scientific visualization, etc.), and finishing up my book on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Facebook-API-Developers-Guide/8672611380">Facebook API</a>.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430209690/"> <img style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YiSZ1UfJL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA240_SH20_OU01_.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="left" /></a>

This is the first book I've written and I have to admit it was far more of a task than I had first thought it would be. Not that the subject matter was very dense, but there were at least four major changes in the API that required an almost total rewrite of the code base for the examples. There were even a couple of sections that had to get cut because Facebook "fixed" their code because of security and user concerns (plus a lot of folks "abuse" some of the things you could do with the API).

There are some great Coldfusion resources for building Facebook applications in ColdFusion. The "un-official" ColdFusion client library for Facebook apps is at <a href="http://www.nearpersonal.com/code/">nearpersonal</a>. There is also a RIAForge starter project for FBML (FBML is a tag based language for Facebook) named <a href="http://fbmlstarter.riaforge.org/">Facebook FBML Starter Kit</a>.

So, if you're wanting a short book that highlights some of the more common elements of developing Facebook applications, be sure to check out my book!
