    developer to work with on an open source app that enables anyone to collaborate

Over the last year our library has used its Facebook application to let students see where their friends are in the library and expose library resources to users without needing to go to another website. It's been used pretty heavily and there are a lot of folks in the library world who have asked to get the source.

This summer Phil spent a couple of weeks rewriting the code to be a little easier to maintain. We reimplemented the code with <a href="http://www.smarty.net/">Smarty</a> and reimplemented the locational device to use FBJS instead of regenerating an image when someone clicked on the map (it's much faster now).
